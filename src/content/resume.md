Contributed to DOE funded project TAU Commander. Improved reach of the
TAU profiler to be more user friendly. Integrated Python support,
supported Chrome browser for trace visualization in the TAU Commander
workflow, and tab auto completion of commands.

Created ParaTools chatbot, leveraging ChatGPT and Gemini APIs to improve
developer productivity with LLMs.

Made promotional videos for Adaptive Computing Inc.'s ODDC cloud
software for ParaTools Pro for E4Sâ„¢: Extreme-Scale Scientific Stack
(E4S). Worked on testing of E4S containers on NVIDIA H100 and AMD MI300A
GPUs to develop and train new machine learning models.

  **Data Science Intern**              Jul 2023 -- Aug 2023
  *San Diego Supercomputer Center*           *La Jolla, CA*
  ---------------------------------- ----------------------

-  Conducted in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on BurnPro3D
  wildfire simulation data, leveraging data visualization tools to
  correlate key features for runtime prediction and produce an optimized
  dataset for models.

-  Framed the runtime prediction challenge as both classification and
  regression tasks, developing and evaluating multiple machine learning
  models to predict runtime as accurately as possible.

    **[Hurricane Damage Prediction](https://github.com/devinshende/HurricanePredictionML)** $|$ *Python, Keras*     Oct 2024 -- Dec 2024
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------

  -  Collaborated on a 5-person research team to integrate additional
    data sources with the goal of enhancing model accuracy for damage
    classification in a dataset containing satellite images of houses
    after hurricane Katrina.

  -  Designed and trained CNN, ResNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT)
    models for binary damage classification using before-and-after
    hurricane images. Enhanced the original Kaggle dataset with
    additional satellite imagery to see if we could improve performance.
